# code-chalenge-2
The code in the index.html links and runs my JavaScript code which is tthe shopping.js
The shopping.js is used by a user to create a shopping list which the user can add items, mark them as bought and also clears the list
The user will be able to do this through the buttons present in the website 
-The add item will add an item to the users shopping list
-The Mark as bought button slices the selected item therefore marking it as bought
-The clear list clears the list but prompts to the user for him/her to confirm the action.
The shopping.css was used to be able to strike through the items once marked as purchased.
It was also added to design my website
